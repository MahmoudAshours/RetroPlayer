# RetroPlayer

A Flutter game project participating in [#Hack20](https://flutterhackathon.com/#/) flutter hackathon.

Youtube demo link [here](https://youtu.be/zgTaa--_svc)

## Project description 

*RetroPlayer* is a cool retro-futuristic 2-D game , where you enter the world of futuristic ideas , Where *Tobor* your AI friend guides you to help him to defeat the evil *Retro-cyber-Letters* (A,B,C,D,etc..).
You ride a large *Retro-Panzer* and help Tobor to shoot all the evil letters.

The game is still under development for the hackathon . It'll be built for Android , IOS & probably web. 

The project isn't yet fully completed , some main features of the game are missing due to no time.

## Project features 

This section will contain a breif explanation of every feauture in the app , a medium article will be written soon after the hackathon ends.

- The Retro-Cyber-letters are attacking Tobor , if they reached the central circle , Tobor will die. With his death the ideal futiristic world is ruined and controlled by the evil letters.

- You ride the Retro-Panzer and point your laser-gun onto each letter , by pointing on the letters they'll die.


## Getting Started

### Basic Tasks : 
- [x] Build up the idea ( max 2 hours) 
- [x] Build up a mock UI sequence *scratch* for mobile and web. (max 1 hour) 
- [x] Initiate project locally & Git.
- [x] Build up the app .
- [x] Test it on 3 android devices , web version & IOS version. 
- [x] Test it with codemagic.
- [x] Make a simple 1 min video (Integration between real video & walkthroughs) 
- [] Make packages of widgets (Retro-Futuristic widgets) - not finished yet //TODO

## Future tasks :
- [ ] Add API documentation + readme.
- [ ] Upload the packages on pub.dev
- [ ] Submit the application.

## Upcoming features 
I plan to complete working on this project , but after learning **FLame** Which is a game engine for flutter . 

- [ ] Not all letters have the same power , each letter has the *Ascilion power* Where the King **Z** is the letter which controls other letters to attack Tobor.
- [ ] Letters have Life points according to their size , where the letter Q is geometrically drew larger than Y for example.
- [ ] Adding different languages not only english. 
- [ ] Including all different Retro-Futuristic fonts (Elixia , Blanka , etc..)


This section maybe long , it'll be my own walkthrough the hackathon days!

# Conclusion 
I really had fun participating in #Hack20 , it was cool experience which allowed me to build a new idea. (Unfortunately I didn't complete the whole project due to issues). 
But it was cool experience building mockups , also searching & building up great and different ideas in a short period of time!
